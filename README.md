> _This file is a work in progress._

Starting a new WordPress project can seem intimidating. We believe that WordPress projects should be as simple as possible to keep our team moving as quick as possible.

This starter project is a collection of techniques acquired over the years working with WordPress for enterprise organizations.

## Requirements

Before getting started, there are a couple of system requirements:

* Lando ([Installation](https://docs.lando.dev/getting-started/installation.html)) - Be sure you're running the latest version.
* Docker ([Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
* Composer ([Installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md))

## Getting started

This project can be installed to your machine using Composer (**Note:** Change `wordpress-project-name` to your project's name):
