ðŸ¦„ Wordpress Starter Project by Mythic Digital ðŸ¦„
This file is a work in progress.

Starting a new Wordpress project can seem intimidating. We believe that Wordpress projects should be as simple as possible to keep our team moving as quick as possible.

This starter project is a collection techniques acquired over the years working with Wordpress for enterprise organizations.

Getting started
This project can be installed to your machine using Composer:

$ composer create-project mythic/wordpress-starter-project wordpress-project-name
Note: Change wordpress-project-name to your project's name.
